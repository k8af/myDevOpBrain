# Open archival information system (OAIS) — Reference model
## Space data and information transfer systems
THIS STANDARD WAS LAST REVIEWED AND CONFIRMED IN #2018. THEREFORE THIS VERSION REMAINS CURRENT.

The [ISO 14721:2012](https://www.iso.org/standard/57284.html) Standard defines the reference model for an #open #archival information system (#OAIS). An #OAIS is an #archive, consisting of an #organization, which may be part of a larger #organization, of people and systems that has accepted the responsibility to #preserve information and make it #available for a designated #community. 

It meets a set of such #responsibilities as defined in this International Standard, and this allows an OAIS archive to be distinguished from other uses of the term "archive". The term "open" in #OAIS is used to imply that ISO 14721:2012, as well as future related International Standards, are developed in open forums, and it does not imply that access to the archive is unrestricted.
