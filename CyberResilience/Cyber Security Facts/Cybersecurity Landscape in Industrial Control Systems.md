<summary>Abstract</summary>
[[Industrial control systems]] (ICSs) are transitioning from legacy-electromechanical-based systems to modern information and communication technology (ICT)-based systems creating a close coupling between cyber and physical components. In this paper, we explore the ICS cybersecurity landscape including: 
1) the key principles and unique aspects of [[ICS operation]]; 
2) a brief history of [[cyberattacks on ICS]]; 
3) an overview of [[ICS security assessment]]; 
4) a survey of [[“uniquely-ICS” testbeds]] that capture the interactions between the various layers of an ICS; 
5) [[Trends in ICS attacks and defenses]] currently known.
