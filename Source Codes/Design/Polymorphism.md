# One Interface, Multiple Methods
## Dynamic Method Dispatch
Dynamic Method Dispatch or #Runtime #Polymorphism is one of the powerful mechanisms that #object-oriented design brings to bear on code #reuse and #robustness. You can call methods on instances of new classes without recompiling while maintaining a clean abstract interface.

Overridden methods giv us the chance to call our methods of any derived classes without even knowing the type of the derived object.
There is no need to remember different names while create new methods that implicitly deliver access to those parent class.

Any class has the ability to inherit its methods to child classes to complete the base or parent class functionality of its methods.

Multiple inheritance then enables #hierarchical #inheritance or #cyclical #inheritance  type of object model.
The abstract classes share methods or properties of the base class for their own purpose.
