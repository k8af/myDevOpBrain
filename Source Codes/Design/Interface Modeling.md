# Finding Best Fit For Customers need
## How can we measure levels of fitting the best object model ?
We need to find out which order is the best way to improve the ability of small changes and handy inheritances from our base/parent classes. With this in mind we implicitly assume to watch the actual way of the data from base/parent object to abtract layer objects.

As we can confirm the best order to inherit data from one class to another, we can build a visualization of the class denotations.
