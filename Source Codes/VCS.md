In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), **version control** (also known as **revision control**, **source control**, or **source code management**) is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to [computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program"), documents, large web sites, or other collections of information. Version control is a component of [software configuration management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management "Software configuration management").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control#cite_note-Mercurial-1)

Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp "Timestamp") and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing "Writing") has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of [book editions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edition_(book) "Edition (book)") and of [specification revisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard) "Specification (technical standard)") are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development"), where a team of people may concurrently make changes to the same files.

**Version control systems** (**#VCS**) are most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as [word processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor "Word processor") and [spreadsheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet "Spreadsheet"), collaborative [web docs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupware "Groupware")[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control#cite_note-2) and in various [content management systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system "Content management system"), e.g., Wikipedia's [page history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Page_history "Help:Page history"). Revision control allows for the ability to revert a document to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and [spamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming "Spamming") in [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki").
