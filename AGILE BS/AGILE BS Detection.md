[The US Department of Defense on How to Detect #agile BS] (https://thenewstack.io/the-u-s-department-of-defense-on-how-to-detect-agile-bs)

Release of [an informative new document from the U.S. Department of Defense](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Oct/09/2002049591/-1/-1/0/DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF) (DoD) offering advice to managers on how to fine-tune their #projects.

The Defense Department’s “Office of Prepublication and Security Review” had cleared the document, “Detecting Agile BS,” for release in October, but it finally went viral last week, attracting [2,975 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ag7vh4/detecting_agile_bullshit_from_the_us_department/?st=jqzy08gh&sh=b20ba5ab) on Reddit, and hundreds of comments from geeks around the world.

Try to spot #projects “that are simply #waterfall or #spiral #development in #agile clothing.” 
One attempted #hybrid of #Waterfall and #Agile #development has been dubbed “water-Scrum-fall,” but the document warns against #imposters trying to claim this is #agile #development, using the sardonic moniker “agile-scrum-fall”.
