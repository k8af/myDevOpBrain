# How to identify six signs that a project isn’t really using an agile development methodology
## lack of collaboration with end users

Nobody on the software development team is talking with and observing the users of the software in action; we mean the actual users of the actual code.1 (The Program Executive Office (PEO) does not count as an actual user, nor does the commanding officer, unless she uses the code.)

*“missing-in-action throughout development.”*

## no Prototypes for testing with users

Continuous feedback from users to the development team (bug reports, users assessments) is not available. Talking once at the beginning of a program to verify requirements doesn’t count!


## loss of feedback. 
*“At a minimum, they should be present during Release Planning and User Acceptance Testing.”*

Meeting requirements is treated as more important than getting something useful into the field as quickly as possible.    
Acceptable substitutes for talking to users: Observing users working, putting prototypes in front of them for feedback, and other aspects of user research that involve less talking.


WORKING DOCUMENT // DRAFT

-   Stakeholders (development, test, ops, security, contracting, contractors, end-users, etc.)2 are acting more-or-less autonomously (e.g. ‘it’s not my job.’)
    
-   End users of the software are missing-in-action throughout development; at a minimum they should be present during Release Planning and User Acceptance Testing.
    
-   #DevSecOps culture is lacking if manual processes are tolerated when such processes can and should be automated (e.g. automated testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery).
