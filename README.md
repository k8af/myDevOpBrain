# myDevOpBrain
## MOC - myDevOpBrain
Map Of Content - of my sophisticated but chaotic brain

Use it as an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) project template that works the same way as my latest devop brain-station - it just uses even weblinks
to connect pieces of information together, for organization and systematicly structure for easy retrieval and memorization.

Its just an Alpha state.

have fun!
